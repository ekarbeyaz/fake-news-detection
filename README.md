# DETECTING FAKE NEWS WITH PYTHON
In this tutorial we will learn how to detect fake news with using Python. First we will learn terms that related to this project like fake news, TfidfVectorizer and PassiveAggressiveClassifier. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.

### Steps of the project
1. We are going to import necessary libraries
2. Read the data, dataset is in project folder in .rar format. All you need to do, is just exract .rar to working directory
3. Split the dataset
4. Train the TfidfVectorizer
5. Train and predict
